        <h3>Challenges (CXO Perspective)</h3>
        <p>
          Hospitals operated with patient data spread across monitoring devices, appointment
          systems, lab reports, and manual records, leaving leadership without a unified view of
          patient health or operational efficiency. Clinical teams reacted to isolated alerts rather
          than longitudinal trends, while administrative workflows added cost and delay without
          improving outcomes. The lack of a connected system made proactive care difficult,
          increased dependency on manual coordination, and limited the hospital’s ability to scale
          remote monitoring and preventive care.

        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>
          I designed this platform as a unified hospital management system to connect patient
          monitoring, clinical records, appointments, and follow-ups under one operational layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          By integrating real-time vitals, reports, and doctor workflows, the system transformed
          fragmented care processes into a continuous, responsive patient journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          It enabled hospitals to monitor patients beyond physical boundaries, act early on health
          deviations, and coordinate care with clarity across in-hospital and remote settings.

              <!-- <h3>Story behind the build</h3> -->
              <h4>The project began with a simple but uncomfortable observation:</h4>
              <p>
                hospitals were collecting more patient data than ever, yet acting on it later than
                they should. Vitals were monitored, reports were generated, and appointments were
                scheduled, but each system operated in isolation. Care teams were reacting to
                snapshots instead of understanding patients as continuous clinical narratives.<br /><br />

                The earliest work did not start with screens. It started by mapping how a patient
                actually moves through care, admission, monitoring, escalation, discharge, and
                follow-up. That exercise exposed a gap between how hospitals document care and how
                care actually unfolds over time. Data existed, but context did not.<br /><br />
                The system was designed to close that gap. Instead of treating vitals, reports, and
                appointments as separate modules, everything was anchored to a single patient
                timeline. Each decision point, an alert, a prescription, a follow-up, became a
                response to patient behaviour, not an administrative task.<br /><br />
                <br />
                <br />
                As the build matured, the platform evolved from managing records to supporting
                clinical judgment. Doctors could see patterns forming, not just values crossing
                thresholds. The system stopped asking clinicians to search for information and began
                presenting it when it mattered.

        <div class="Closing-Study">
          <h4>Closing the Case Study</h4>
          <p>
            This system was built to resolve fragmentation in hospital operations — where clinical
            care, patient monitoring, and administration often operate in silos. Designing across a
            desktop hospital interface, a patient-facing RPM mobile application, and a backend
            control system revealed how continuity of care depends as much on systems as on
            medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key learning was structural: healthcare workflows do not fail due to lack of intent,
            but due to broken handoffs. By aligning data, responsibility, and visibility across
            stakeholders, the platform turned monitoring into intervention and administration into
            enablement. Here, design became a clinical support system — precise, restrained, and
            accountable.
